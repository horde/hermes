Installation
============

Instructions for installing Hermes can be found in the file INSTALL_ in the
``docs/`` directory of the Hermes distribution.


Configuration
=============

Editing Submitted Time
----------------------

By default, users cannot edit submitted time.  Specific users or groups can be
granted the ability to edit submitted (but not exported) time by granting the
"EDIT" permission for "Hermes -> Time Review Screen" (see "Permissions" from
the Administration menu for more info).  This will enable them to edit
submitted time from anywhere they can see it, which right now means from the
Search screen.

This permission also gives the user the ability to mark time as exported when
downloading it.

Cost Objects
------------

Other applications can supply cost objects to track time against.

Currently, Whups_ (the ticket-tracking system) will export its tickets as
possible cost object. If you configure an additional attribute for your ticket
types and make its name "Estimated Time", Whups will also be able to export
estimates on the tickets, allowing Hermes to indicate the ticket's percentage
complete. The same happens automatically with tasks exported from Nag_ as cost
objects.
